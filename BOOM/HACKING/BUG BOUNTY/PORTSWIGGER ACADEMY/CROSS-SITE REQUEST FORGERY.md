Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.


## IMPACT OF CSRF

In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer. Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

## HOW DOES CSRF WORK?

For a CSRF to be possible, three conditions must be in place:

A relevant action: privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).
Cookie-based session handling: application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.
No unpredictable request parameters: The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess.

For example, suppose an application contains a function that lets the user change the email address on their account. When a user performs this action, they make an HTTP request like the following:
`POST /email/change HTTP/1.1 
`Host: vulnerable-website.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
`Content-Length: 30 
`Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE 
`email=wiener@normal-user.com`
This meets the conditions required for CSRF:

- The action of changing the email address on a user's account is of interest to an attacker. Following this action, the attacker will typically be able to trigger a password reset and take full control of the user's account.
- The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request. There are no other tokens or mechanisms in place to track user sessions.
- The attacker can easily determine the values of the request parameters that are needed to perform the action.
With these conditions in place, the attacker can construct a web page containing the following HTML:

If a victim user visits the attacker's web page, the following will happen:

- The attacker's page will trigger an HTTP request to the vulnerable website.
- If the user is logged in to the vulnerable website, their browser will automatically include their session cookie in the request (assuming SameSite cookies are not being used).
- The vulnerable website will process the request in the normal way, treat it as having been made by the victim user, and change their email address.

## MAKING A CSRF ATTACK

- Select a request anywhere in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or exploit.
- From the right-click context menu, select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.
- Burp Suite will generate some HTML that will trigger the selected request (minus cookies, which will be added automatically by the victim's browser).
- You can tweak various options in the CSRF PoC generator to fine-tune aspects of the attack. You might need to do this in some unusual situations to deal with quirky features of requests.
- Copy the generated HTML into a web page, view it in a browser that is logged in to the vulnerable website, and test whether the intended request is issued successfully and the desired action occurs.

## How to secure a WebSocket connection

To minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities arising with WebSockets, use the following guidelines:

- Use the `wss://` protocol (WebSockets over TLS).
- Hard code the URL of the WebSockets endpoint, and certainly don't incorporate user-controllable data into this URL.
- Protect the WebSocket handshake message against CSRF, to avoid cross-site WebSockets hijacking vulnerabilities.
- Treat data received via the WebSocket as untrusted in both directions. Handle data safely on both the server and client ends, to prevent input-based vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
